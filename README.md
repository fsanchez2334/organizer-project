<h1> Organizer-Project</h1>
<p>In this new application, the aim is to help teenagers from our school to keep themselves organized. Like some of our competitors, this application mainly serves as a planner that can help you keep track of assignments by reminding you to 
submit them right on time. The application is also programmed with the grading system that the school uses. However, depending on the grade received, there may be an incentive that rewards the completion and grade
received on such assignment. The application itself also works off a certain point system of its own. Depending on the amount of assignments completed and the grades on those assignments, a number of points is dispensed to the student, and after
a trimester is completed, those points can then yield possible rewards such as movie tickets, discounts, coupons etc {that may be a far strectched idea, but as of now, it remains a possibility}
